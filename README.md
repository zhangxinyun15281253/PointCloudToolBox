# Point Cloud ToolBox


This point cloud processing tool library can be used to process point clouds, 3d meshes, and voxels.

## Environment
```markdown
python 3.7.5

Dependent packages:
- torch==1.7.1+cu101
- openmesh==1.1.6
- open3d==0.13.0
- plyfile==0.7.4
- numpy==1.21.0
- vtk==8.2.0
- python-pcl==0.3.0rc1

How to install the environment:
# pip install requirements.txt
```

## Todo
### Point Cloud

     - [x] pcd -> xyz | pts | txt | csv | ply 
     - [x] las -> pcd | xyz | pts | ply | txt | csv
     - [x] ply -> pcd | xyz | pts | txt | csv   
     - [x] xyz -> pcd | pts | ply | txt | csv
     - [x] pts -> pcd | xyz | ply | txt | csv
     - [x] txt -> pcd | ply | xyz | pts
